As is plainly visible, I haven't updated this blog in roughly six months. During that time, I've started some exciting new projects at work and backpacked through Europe for 5 weeks! As much as I enjoy blogging about Java, you can see that there are slightly more exciting things keeping me busy. 

In the coming few weeks I plan to post about a few cool new things I've been working with at work. I've also started using twitter more actively and I plan to integrate that into the website in some form as well. Perhaps I'll post some photos from Europe as well.

Stay tuned!
