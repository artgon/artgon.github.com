meta-description: A quick guide for setting up role-based authentication in AngularJS

We've recently started on a new product at [work](http://www.learndot.com "Learndot")
using the [AngularJS framework](http://www.angularjs.org "AngularJS").
One of the most useful resources when starting out was the _#angularjs_
room on [freenode](http://freenode.net/ "Freenode"). There seems to be a really large, vibrant
community around AngularJS and that's always helpful when starting from
scratch on a new framework. One of the best resources in the room was
[David Mosher](https://twitter.com/dmosher "David Mosher"), who helped us get set up with
[Lineman](https://linemanjs.com "Lineman") -- an awesome build framework based on
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "Grunt") -- and pointed us to some of his [video tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/vidjadavemo). 
Honestly, these were a great resource for getting started and highly recommend watching them. The following tutorial is heavily inspired by 
the examples David provided.
