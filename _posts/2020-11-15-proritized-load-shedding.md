title: "Keeping Netflix Reliable Using Prioritized Load Shedding"
meta-description: Prioritized load shedding to increase availability
---

We often see traffic spikes, typically caused by internal failures but
sometimes also by external attacks. When this happens, Zuul needs to
keep itself up by dropping requests, and subsequently keep backends
happy by not letting them get overloaded. This raises the interesting 
question of which requests do we drop? 

We've invested in building out a system to prioritize traffic and shed
the lower priority non-playback traffic first, progressively increasing to higher
priorities.  

You can read the full blog post [here](https://netflixtechblog.com/keeping-netflix-reliable-using-prioritized-load-shedding-6cc827b02f94), it has a lot of detail but here's the real money shot:

There are some really interesting aspects to what we built, in particular the cubic progression of priority throttling.

> The graph above is an example of how the cubic function is applied. As the overload percentage increases (i.e. the range between the throttling threshold and the max capacity), the priority threshold trails it very slowly: at 35%, itâ€™s still in the mid-90s. If the system continues to degrade, we hit priority 50 at 80% exceeded and then eventually 10 at 95%, and so on.

This has been really effective in practice. If there is a blip or a
minor issue (even a medium issue) there is almost no impact on customers trying to watch a
movie. They won't get affected until we get into the sharp side of the
cubic curve, which means things are in a really bad state.

There's tons more info in the [post](https://netflixtechblog.com/keeping-netflix-reliable-using-prioritized-load-shedding-6cc827b02f94) (check out the backpressure
mechanism), it's worth reading if you're interested in building resilient systems at scale.
